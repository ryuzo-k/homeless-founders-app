# Country Registration and Filtering Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The country dropdown in the hacker house registration form was using full country names as display text but not matching the expected lowercase country codes in the JavaScript mapping logic. This caused all registrations to default to "other" because the mapping couldn't find matches.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Registration Form (`house.html`)
- Updated country dropdown options to use consistent lowercase values:
  - Japan: value="japan"
  - USA: value="usa" 
  - UK: value="uk"
  - Singapore: value="singapore"
  - Canada: value="canada"
  - Australia: value="australia"
  - Germany: value="germany"
  - France: value="france"
  - Netherlands: value="netherlands"
  - Other: value="other"

### 2. Edit House Form (`edit-house.html`)
- Applied the same country dropdown fixes to ensure consistency between registration and editing

### 3. JavaScript Logic (`script.js`)
- Verified the `registerHackerHouse` function correctly maps country values to regions
- Verified the `filterByCountry` function correctly filters houses by country
- Verified the `loadHackerHousesList` function applies country filtering properly
- Verified the `getCountryName` function maps country codes to display names correctly

### 4. Database Operations (`supabase-db.js`)
- Verified the `createHackerHouse` function includes the country field in database inserts
- Fixed the `updateHackerHouse` function to properly include the country field in updates

## Testing Performed

### Registration Flow Test
- Verified that each country dropdown value correctly maps to its expected region
- Verified that each region correctly maps to its expected emoji icon
- All test cases passed successfully

### Country Filtering Test
- Verified that the filtering logic correctly matches houses by their country field
- All filtering test cases passed successfully

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. When users select a country from the dropdown during registration, the correct country code will be saved to the database
2. Houses will no longer default to "other" for their country field
3. Country filtering on the browse houses page will work correctly
4. The edit house form will maintain country information correctly

## Files Modified
- `/house.html` - Fixed country dropdown options
- `/edit-house.html` - Fixed country dropdown options
- `/script.js` - Verified country mapping logic
- `/supabase-db.js` - Verified database operations include country field
