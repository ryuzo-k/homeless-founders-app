# Country Registration and Filtering Issue - Fixed

## Problem Description
The country dropdown in the hacker house registration form was not working correctly. Regardless of which country users selected, all houses were being saved with "other" as their country in the Supabase database.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code, I found that the issue was in the HTML forms where the country dropdown options were not using the correct value attributes that match the JavaScript mapping logic:

1. In `house.html` and `edit-house.html`, the country dropdown options were using full country names as both display text and values
2. The JavaScript code in `script.js` expects specific lowercase country codes like "usa", "uk", "japan" for the country-to-region mapping
3. When the form submitted values like "United States" or "United Kingdom", the mapping logic couldn't find matches and defaulted to "other"

## Solution Implemented
I updated the country dropdown options in both forms to use the correct value attributes:

### Registration Form (`house.html`)
- Changed "United States" option to have `value="usa"`
- Changed "United Kingdom" option to have `value="uk"`
- Kept other options with their correct lowercase values

### Edit House Form (`edit-house.html`)
- Applied the same fixes for consistency

### JavaScript Logic Verification
- Verified that the `registerHackerHouse` function correctly maps country codes to regions
- Verified that the `updateHackerHouse` function properly includes the country field
- Verified that the country filtering functionality works as expected

## Testing Results
I created and ran comprehensive tests to verify the fixes:

1. **Registration Flow Test** - ✅ PASSED
   - All country values correctly map to their expected regions
   - All regions correctly map to their expected emoji icons

2. **Country Filtering Test** - ✅ PASSED
   - Filtering by any country returns the correct results
   - The "other" category works properly

3. **End-to-End Test** - ✅ PASSED
   - Complete flow from registration to filtering works correctly
   - All 10 test countries (japan, usa, uk, singapore, canada, australia, germany, france, netherlands, other) work properly

## Files Modified
- `/house.html` - Fixed country dropdown options
- `/edit-house.html` - Fixed country dropdown options
- `/supabase-db.js` - Verified database operations include country field

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Users can now select any country from the dropdown and it will be correctly saved in the database
2. Country filtering on the browse houses page will work correctly
3. The edit house form will maintain country information properly
4. Houses will display with the correct emoji icons based on their regions

The issue has been completely resolved and all country-related functionality is now working as expected.
